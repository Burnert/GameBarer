# GameBarer

A better version of Game Bar, that isn't really a game bar, but allows you to use the Win+Alt+B shortcut available in Game Bar to toggle HDR on your display.

## Building

You must have Odin and Windows SDK installed.
Then just run build-debug.bat or build-release.bat, or use vscode tasks.

## Usage

1. Run the .exe and press Win+Alt+B.
2. Have fun toggling your HDR :)
